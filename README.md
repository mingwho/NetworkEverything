#### Idea and program structure:
I want to make a wearable luminous knitted necklace as an IoT art project. The inspiration is from [this project](http://www.instructables.com/id/Arty-IoT-/) I ran into on Instructables.

For this project, the program will be composed of two parts: one for the web interface so that users can control the lights or NeoPixels with their input. The other part will be for the Arduino to actually change light color.

- Useful: <a href = "https://www.fitbit.com/home">Fitbit</a>

I work out 5 days a week and runs 3 miles a day usually. And Fitbit would be a very helpful fitness device that documents the steps taken, calorie burnt, and heart rate for me. It also syncs the data on mobile apps. I think Fitbit is a beautiful product that targets toward specific use cases (gym, workout, and fitness).

- Useless: <a href = "http://www.loreal.com/media/press-releases/2017/jan/kerastase-and-withings-unveil-worlds-first-smart-hairbrush-at-ces-2017">Kérastase Hair Coach brush</a>

This hair brush uses a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and a microphone to listen to your hair to see if you’re brushing it all wrong.
"All of the data collected by the Kérastase Hair Coach brush is passed onto its accompanying smartphone app over wi-fi or Bluetooth which collects additional environmental data—like temperature, humidity, UV, and wind—from local weather forecasts to give the user an overall hair quality score, but also tips on how to improve their brushing habits to in turn improve the health of their hair."
